Last month, Bluesky began proxying requests to the App View. 

For some users, this caused an **invalid handle** error. If you have an invalid handle, the user-facing UI will display the image below instead of your handle:

You can use Bluesky [debugging tool](https://bsky-debug.app/handle) to investigate this:  
- Just type your handle in. 

1. If it shows no error, please try updating your handle to the same handle you currently have to resolve this issue.

1. If the debugging page shows an error for your handle, follow this [guide](https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/4-28-2023-domain-handle-tutorial) to make sure you set up your handle properly.

1. If that still isn’t working for you, file a support ticket through the app (“Help” button in the left menu on mobile or right side on desktop) and a Bluesky team member will assist you.
