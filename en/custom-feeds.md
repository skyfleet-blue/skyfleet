### Categorization

- The categories have been built as feeds arrived, so the list is not necessarily complete or inclusive for all scenarios. If an important category is missing, feel free to suggest it or propose a Feed using the "Other" category, more information below:

#### Other

If you can't find a category that fits your Feed, use the "Other" category. A new text field will appear, allowing you to suggest a category.
- Try to choose something neutral and general that can be used by the community and not just for your feed.

> As we receive new categories of custom feeds, this directory will be updated to include the suggested categories.
